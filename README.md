For 2017+ - These days, I'd recommend that for the realtime mirror reflections you use the new cinematic effects - the Screen Space reflections from Unity.

I put together this tutorial on using the realtime Global Illumination in Unity 5 - specifically, how I put together the scene that is in this video:
  
It's a very beginner tutorial that looks at how to set up the realtime global illumination, how to use the procedural built-in skybox to create a day/night cycle and how to create a reflective flat surface using the built-in reflection probes.

It goes through quite a bit of information, so please let me know if anything needs to be clarified.  I'm assuming a basic understanding of how to use Unity, add GameObjects, use the inspector, create materials, etc.

The RGB colors for the water albedo (which I forgot to mention in the video), is R: 1,  G: 9,  B: 23

You're free to use the knowledge imparted here in your own projects of course.  If you use the scripts or derive from them all I ask is that you give a credit to me and point to my website - glenrhodes.com.
